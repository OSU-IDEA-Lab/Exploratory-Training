# Exploratory-Training
In this paper, we build theoretical underpinnings and design algorithms to develop systems that collaborate with users to learn the target model accurately and efficiently. At the core of our proposal, a game-theoretic framework models the joint learning of user and system to reach a desirable eventual stable state.
